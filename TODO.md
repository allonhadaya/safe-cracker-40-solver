Short circuit branches where a known bad hole is re-exposed.
To demonstrate the concept, align all the rings (hole to hole; cell to cell) and turn any one of them independently two clicks.
If the original column checked represents a bad set, all even clicks may be avoided as options. [2, 4 .. 14] and itself of course.
